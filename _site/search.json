We have the sum of squared residuals, so we need to square root to get back to just regular ol’ residuals. We also need to divide by something to account for the degrees of freedom, thus \\(n-2\\). Interested in why we divide by 2? (tldr; residual degrees of freedom.)\nCONFIDENCE INTERVAL \\(\\hat{B_1} \\pm 2SE(\\hat{B_1})\\)\nWhat is a confidence interval tho? values that with 95% probability, the range will contain the true unknown value\nHere’s a thread to help understand:\n\n\nHey Stats folk, what's your 280 character definition of a confidence interval?🤔\n\n— Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti (@ChelseaParlett) March 13, 2018\n\n\n\nkey takeaways:"
