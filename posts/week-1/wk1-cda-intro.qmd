"A good model is one that accurately predicts the outcome." (sometimes)

Learning primer:

On types of data:

    - Unstructured data does not follow any rhyme or reason
    - Semi-structured has some consitency, but no precise structure
    - Structured data has persistent order

On model outputs: 

    - Quantitative data can be measured (numeric)
    - Qualitative data is descriptive (categorical) but qualitatative

On types of model:

    - Supervised learning is labeled data
        - Some issues in supervised learning could be overfitting
    - Unsupervised learning is unlabeled data
        - Some issues could be know

matricies: rectangular array,
size (row, column)
special <3 for SQUARE (n,n) matricies

$$
A=[a_{ij}]
$$ 
(the entry on row i and column j of matrix A)

if $A$ and $B$ are the same size, 

$A + B$

$B - B$

$cA + rB$ <- this is also called a linear combination of A and B

$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -1 & 1\\
0 & 2 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
$$

If you're like me and immediately think "oh yeah, I'm going to mae a computer do that," be forewarned--dot products do not work as expected out of the box in base Python OR base R! :) 

Python:
```{python}
#| eval: false
# python

A = [[1,-1,1],[0,2,4]]
B = [[2,-10,7], [3,8,6]]

A+2*B # okay, this actually doesn't work
```
```
[[1, -1, 1], [0, 2, 4], [2, -10, 7], [3, 8, 6], [2, -10, 7], [3, 8, 6]]
```
R:
```{r}
#| eval: false
# R

matrix1 <- matrix(c(3, 9, -1, 4, 2, 6), nrow = 2)
matrix2 <- matrix(c(5, 2, 0, 9, 3, 4), nrow = 3)

matrix1*matrix2 # OKAY THIS DOESNT WORK EITHER
```
```
Error in matrix1 * matrix2 : non-conformable arrays
```

So neither of these languages support matrix multiplication the way you multiply numbers. How do we do this?

Python:
```{python}
A = [[1,-1,1],[0,2,4]]
B = [[2,-10,7], [3,8,6]]

A+2*B # okay, this actually doesn't work
```

R:
```{r}
matrix1 <- matrix(c(3, 9, -1, 4, 2, 6), nrow = 2)
matrix2 <- matrix(c(5, 2, 0, 9, 3, 4), nrow = 2)

matrix1*matrix2 # OKAY THIS DOESNT WORK EITHER
```


# Matrix multiplication
dot product result is ALWAYS A NUMBER
    - use dot product to create matrix multiplication

Notation:

- Quantitative output: Y
- Qualitative output: G
- Matrix: **A**

I wanted to add more on how to do matrix multiplication and such, but I will never do as good of a job as https://e2eml.school/transformers.html

# Linear Models:
    - you would use regression for numerical
    - you would use classification for 

$$
y = mx+b
$$

where x = input
      y = output
      w = $\begin{bmatrix} m \\ b \end{bmatrix}$

goal is to make the line of best fit of the weights

Given input vector $X^T = (X_1, X_2, ..., X_p)$ we predict $Y$ by 
$$
\hat{Y}= \hat{B} + (X_1\hat{B_1}+ X_1\hat{B_2} + ... + X_p\hat{B_p})
$$
$$
\hat{Y}= \sum_{j=1}^PX_j\hat{B_j}
$$
where $\hat{B_j} $ is the intercept.

If you have a vector $X=\begin{bmatrix}X_1 \\ X_2 \\ ... \\ X_p\end{bmatrix}$

linear model is 
$$
f(x) = X^T\hat{B}
$$

but many different techniques to have flavors of linear modesl

$$
Error = y - \hat{Y}
$$

How to tell if your model is doing well:

_Residual sum square of errors and least square_
we pick coefficients (weights), $\hat{B}$ to minimize the RSS

$$
RSS(\hat{B})= \sum_{j=1}^N(y_j-x_j^T\hat{B})^2
$$


Simple linear regression:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon
$$

where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are unknown

$$
\hat{y}=\hat{B_0} + \hat{B_1}x
$$

$$
\hat{y_i}=\hat{B_0} + \hat{B_1}x_i 
$$

(is the prediction of Y based on x_i)

$$
e_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}
$$

:::{.callout-important}
where $y_i$ is actual and $\hat{y_i}$ is predicted
:::

The least sqaure is 

$$
\hat{\beta_1} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^N[(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})]}{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\bar{x})^2}
$$

$$
\hat{\beta_0} = \bar{y}-\hat{\beta_1}\bar{x}
$$
