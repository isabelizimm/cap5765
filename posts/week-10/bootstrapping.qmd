# Resampling

Resampling methods involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to obtain additional information about the fitted model.

Gives distribution of sample population

common ways to 

# Bootstrap

The bootstrap is a widely applicable and extremely powerful statistical tool that can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical learning method

bootstrapping was originally a method for assessing statistical accuracy of an estimator

first, each bootstrap sample must be of the same size as the original sample
second, each bookstrap sample must be taken **with replacement** from the original sample

is bootstrapping considered simulated data?
no-- simulated would be new people. this is reusing people

linear function

Beer = $\alpha$ + $\beta$(wings) | n=30

1. take sample n=30
2. do regression to find $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$
3. keep track of $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$
4. do this 10,000 times
5. plot distribution

we end up with a bootstrap distribution for $\hat{\beta}$
